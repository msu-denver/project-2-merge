# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 11/08/24, 2:00 pm
Participants: Hannah, Amina, Logan, Patty

## Sprint Summary

This sprint focused on finalizing and refining the cyber incident management features, including deletion, updates, and the generation of a report for incidents, as well as preparing the deployment environment. We aimed to resolve any remaining issues and ensure each user story met the defined acceptance criteria. The team completed testing and prepared for a final deployment using Docker.

(FAKE) Product Owner Feedback for Final sprint. 

User Story #7 (Update Incidents):
This feature met the expectations. The product owner appreciated the clear layout and intuitive design of the update interface. However, they recommended adding an auto-save feature, which could be considered for a future update.

User Story #8 (Generate Report of Incidents):
The report generation feature was functional, displaying an organized summary of incidents. Minor formatting adjustments were recommended to enhance readability and alignment, especially on mobile devices.

Action Items for Next Sprint

Since this was the final sprint, no additional sprints are planned. However, recommendations were made for future improvements:

Implement an auto save option in the update feature for user convenience.
Refine report formatting for mobile responsiveness.
Conduct additional testing for the delete functionality to improve error handling.

## Additional Notes: 

The team should retain detailed documentation on any unresolved suggestions for potential future development.
Maintain the code repository and Dockerfile configuration for easy re deployment if necessary.
