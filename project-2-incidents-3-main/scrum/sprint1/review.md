# Sprint Review

**Date/Time:** 10/29/24, 2:00 pm  
**Participants:** Lala, Hannah, Patty, Logan  

## Sprint Summary

## Product Owner Feedback

User Story 1 (Registration) and User Story 2 (Authentication):

Product owner identified these as priority items for the next sprint due to incomplete functionality. 
Authentication still has issues and needs further refinement to ensure smooth user access.

User Story 3 (Search Incidents):
Product owner tested functionality; the feature works but requires additional verification steps to ensure full functionality. 

User Story 4 (List Incidents):
Integrates well with User Story 3, allowing users to view results of incident searches in a structured table. Further testing and fine tuning may be needed to ensure optimal integration.

## Action Items for Next Sprint

Prioritize !! User Story 1 (Registration) and User Story 2 (Authentication) to finalize and fully integrate these functions.

Refine User Story 3 to address any remaining issues and ensure the search function is fully operational.

Continue integration work on User Stories 3 and 4 to ensure seamless navigation and display of filtered search results.


## Additional Notes

Team to focus on aligning User Stories 1 and 2 more closely, as both involve user access and authentication processes.
Ensure more thorough testing across all user stories before the next sprint review to confirm functionality and integration.
