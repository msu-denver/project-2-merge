## Key Tasks

## User Stories and Task Assignments
- User Story 1 (User Registration) Assigned To: Lala & Patty
Description: Ensure all inputs are validated and that users can authenticate themselves. All sign-up fields should be mandatory and correctly filled.

User Story: As a user, I want to register on the platform to access the cyber incidents database. When I provide all required information (user ID, name, short description, and password) and click 'submit,' my account should be created successfully. Certain users will also be configured as administrators offline.

Story Point: 1 (☆)

- User Story 2 (Details Pending) Assigned To: Lala & Patty

User Story: As a registered user, I want to log in to the platform. When I enter my user ID and password, the system should verify my credentials. If they match the records in the database, I should be granted access to navigate the app.

Story Point: 1 (☆)

- User Story 3 (Search Functionality) Assigned To: Hannah

As a registered user, I want to search for cyber incidents by entering parameters like year, actor type, industry, motive, event type, and country. Upon entering my search criteria and clicking 'confirm,' I should be redirected to a results section where the incidents are filtered based on my inputs.

Story Point: 2 (☆☆)

- User Story 4 (Description Pending) Assigned To: Logan

As a registered user, I want to view a table summarizing cyber incidents that match specific search criteria. The table should display a limited number of incidents (e.g., 10) on a page to fit the screen, and I should be able to navigate forward and backward through the filtered incidents list.

Story Point: 2 (☆☆)

## Additional Group Tasks

Distribute and assign User Stories 1, 2, 3, and 4 among team members.
Assign story points to each user story.
Break down each user story into actionable subtasks.


## Reminders: 

    follow git best practices! remember to protect main branch and use dev branch
    use temporary sub-branches for each user story and merge them into dev
    don't merge into main until sprint review!
