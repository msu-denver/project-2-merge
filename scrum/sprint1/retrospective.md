# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 10/29/24, 3:00 pm
Participants: Lala, Hannah, Patty, Logan

## What Went Well

Daily Communication: The team maintained consistent communication through daily check-ins on Discord, which helped us address blockers quickly and keep everyone aligned.

Collaboration on User Stories 3 and 4: Integrating these two stories went smoothly, and team members were proactive in supporting each other to ensure both stories worked well together.

## What Could Be Improved

Authentication Functionality: User Stories 1 and 2 faced more challenges than anticipated, and weâ€™ll need to refine our approach to ensure these core features are completed in the next sprint.

Testing Process: Some testing gaps were identified, particularly in verifying User Story 3. Adding more structured testing steps could help catch issues earlier and improve overall product quality.

## Action Items for Next Sprint

Strengthen Testing for critical functions to ensure smoother sprint reviews.
Focus on User Stories 1 and 2 by dedicating more time and resources to complete and fully test authentication.
Continue Daily Communication on Discord to maintain team alignment and quickly address any new blockers.
