# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 11/08/24, 3:00 pm

Participants: Hannah, Amina, Logan, Patty

## What Went Well

Collaboration and Communication:
Consistent daily check-ins helped the team identify blockers and resolve them efficiently. Communication on Discord allowed team members to stay in sync and quickly adjust priorities as needed.

Dockerfile and Deployment Preparation:
The Dockerfile setup went smoothly, allowing us to finalize the deployment process with minimal issues. This saved time during the sprint and made the final submission process easier.

Efficient Task Management:
Each team member completed their assigned tasks on time, which kept the project on schedule and allowed for thorough testing and adjustments.
What Could Be Improved

Early Integration Testing:
The team recognized that starting integration testing earlier could have surfaced a few data binding and display issues sooner, saving time later in the sprint.

## Documentation of Known Issues:
Documenting minor issues encountered during development could improve future troubleshooting. Although these did not block completion, noting these would aid in future maintenance or handover.
Action Items for Future Projects
Schedule earlier integration testing for complex projects to avoid last minute issues.
